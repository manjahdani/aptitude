/** 
 * Agent with a set of tasks (Goals) and a model (Belief). 
 * It bases its computations on a Belief, otherwise a model defined by parameters. 
 * Each agent owns the intrinsic desire to achieve its Goal and become better at it. 
 * 
 * Algorithms are firstly classified according to the Goals ((Detector, Tracker, Vehicle Counter, Offense Detectorâ€¦)) and secondly their belief.  
 * 
 * There will exists as many internal space discussions as there is tasks. 
 * 
 * Initially the algorithm, it exists in the realm of TOLD and within a Holon could exist infinite combination of models and parameters. 
 * 
 * @TODO : Must be somewhere else
 * The algorithm becomes operational when joining a Platform. However, the instance does not join another context but rather provide a replicate.
 * The instance may due to local interactions, evolve to be better than to the original at this specific task and Location. 
 * When that happens, the replicate may choose to adapt its belief accordingly and communicate to the original the decision. 
 * If the latest follows, it universally and automatically suggests to child instances the modification. 
 * They now share a new belief. In the case, it does not follow, the replicate will become a new Holon in the realm of TOLD and becomes a distinct entity
